A new user creates an account with a username, their birthday, and an empty reading log. They select New Reading from the command line interface and they are prompted to select a spread. The user will choose general reading, and then the user will be asked how many times they want to shuffle by inputting an int value between 1-10. The ShuffleManager controller class will shuffle the deck the inputted value about of times. Then the deck will be spread out (shown as a printed list in the command line interface), and the user will be required to select as many cards as the selected spread requires(a general reading requires the user to select 3 cards). The user will be prompted to select the first card, by choosing an index from 1-78. They will then be prompted a second time to choose another card, by again choosing an index from 1-78 (if the user picks the same index they have chosen before, the program raises an exception: Card already chosen. Please choose another card). The program will prompt the user for the third time to choose their final card by choosing an index from 1-78 (if they choose an already chosen card, an exception will be raised: Card already chosen. Please choose another card). Then the program will generate a reading with the three cards they have chosen. The user can then choose to either log this reading in their Reading Log or discard it. Cards will not yet implement the isReversed function.
