## Welcome to TarotReader 3000!

Tarot Readings are a form of fortune-telling through cards. Tarot decks consist of 78 cards divided into two groups; 
The major arcana, which are similar to face cards in a regular card deck. The minor arcana is similar to suit cards in 
a regular playing deck, they are split up into 4 “suits”, pentacles, swords, wands, and cups, and they range from an 
Ace card, cards numbered 2 to 10, and a page, queen, and king card. Each card has a meaning associated with it, and 
when cards are put together, meanings change, which can be interpreted as a fortune.

This app will allow users to create an account, generate readings and interpretations with user-selected spread, look 
up references for card meanings, allow users to log software-generated readings, allow users to log readings they have 
done themselves, delete readings from the log, and allow users to see reading log associated with their account.
